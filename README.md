## More about the project
As I said before, this project is in link with the R1.02 ressource where the purpose was to create a web interface about a domain or a topic which was attractive for us. So we decided to realize a reply of sales site about Cannabidiol, better known as CBD. I realized all part of interface development and content of pages. During the project I used the `css` language (cascading style sheet) and `html` (HyperText Markup Language) for the pages architectures. I also used `javascript` for the implementation of the second style of the web site. It contains a dark theme and also some modifications on the pages.
